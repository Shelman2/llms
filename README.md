# LLMs

A collection of hands-on demos and experiments for running and integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) locally and in .NET.

This repository is meant as a practical playground for developers interested in LLMs, AI agents, and real-world applicationsâ€”focusing on local, private, and cost-effective approaches using the latest .NET features and open-source tooling.

---

## Demos Included

- [OllamaSqlExpert](./OllamaSqlExpert): A .NET console chatbot that answers SQL/database questions, powered by Ollama running a local LLM.
- [SimpleRAGWithOllama](./SimpleRAGOllama): A streamlined implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using C# and the Microsoft Kernel Memory library integrated with Ollama.
- (More coming soon!)

---

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (for local model inference)
- Docker (optional, for running Ollama in a container)

---

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shelman2/llms.git
cd LLMs
```

Each demo includes its own `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.

## Why Local LLMs?

- **Privacy:** Your data stays on your machine.
- **Cost-effective:** No cloud API keys or surprise bills.
- **Experimentation:** Test, tinker, and build at your own pace.
